	<h2> What is Salad?</h2>
	<p> When we hear "salad" we think of bowls filled to the brim with lush greens, 
	hearty vegetables, fresh herbs, creamy cheeses, and rich dressings.<br>
	So you might be surprised to learn that the origin of the word "salad"
	has nothing to do with vegetables and it is mostly linked with salts. </p>
